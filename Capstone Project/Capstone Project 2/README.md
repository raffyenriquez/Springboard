Background

Financing a business has been one of the the biggest challenges for new entrepreneurs. One of the options that they have turned to is crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is a method of raising many small amounts of money from a large number of people. Kickstarter is one of these corporations that maintain a global crowdfunding platform having received more than $3.3 billion dollars pledged to its projects. Its mission is to “help bring creative projects to life”. And it uses an "All-or-Nothing" approach, meaning projects only get funded when campaigns reach their goals.

Of course, not all projects will be successfully funded in the platform. According to Kickstarter itself, success rate within the platform ever since it started is around 35%. The goal of this project is to find ways to increase the probability of getting funded.

Results

The point of this study is to look at how to increase the probability of success from the very start. After looking at the most backed data, it seems that anyone who wish to succeed in raising funds through crowdfunding need to set the lowest goal possible for them to run their campaigns. Lowest goal in this case is the amount an individual can recoup one's costs and at the same time the amount one is willing to put in the work for. And at the same time, they must have an idea of the crowdfunding platform's backers, in this case, Kickstarter's backers are into games and product design.

Should anyone wish to do well, a goal anywhere less than $20,000 seems reasonable and anything related to games and product design should be a good starting point.

It must be emphasized that these results might have some sampling bias from the dataset as it only contained the most backed campaigns. It is possible that there were a lot of campaigns coming from product design and games that really did well compared to the others while other categories did just enough. It is possible that there simply are a lot more campaigns on the product design and games categories than say theatre thus resulting in more per category count. This same reasoning also applies to the goals as there might be a lot of creators that had lowers goals but less success than say fewer creators with higher goals and more success in their campaigns.

There seems to be potential in using text as a determinant of success. It makes sense in that language has been the way of how we communicate and sell our ideas. The blurb is only one such means of doing that. The models created in this study were limited by the amount of features available and there is good reason to believe that it can be further improved upon on.
