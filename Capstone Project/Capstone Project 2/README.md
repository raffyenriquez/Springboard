Background

Financing a business has been one of the the biggest challenges for new entrepreneurs. One of the options that they have turned to is crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is a method of raising many small amounts of money from a large number of people. Kickstarter is one of these corporations that maintain a global crowdfunding platform having received more than $3.3 billion dollars pledged to its projects. Its mission is to “help bring creative projects to life”. And it uses an "All-or-Nothing" approach, meaning projects only get funded when campaigns reach their goals.

Of course, not all projects will be successfully funded in the platform. According to Kickstarter itself, success rate within the platform ever since it started is around 35%. The goal of this project is to find ways to increase the probability of getting funded.
